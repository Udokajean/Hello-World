# Hello-World
Practicing to perfect my linux knowledge
My name is Udokamma Janefrancis Emereonye, I have a master's degree in information system, I love Linux/Unix, I love coding/scripting, I have a blog, am internet savvy, am crazy about computing. These are the things I didn't know about myseld until I migrated to the United State. USA has opened my eyes to so manythings and has helped me to discover myself.
All glory to God, my parent, chidimma and Joe.
